# Entertaining Features

## What is the goal of the Entertaining Features project

The primary objective of the "Entertaining Features" project is to provide a platform for testing a variety of JavaScript features, including:

- Toggling between Dark Mode & Light Mode
- Creating a Burger Menu
- Implementing a Scrolling Modal
- Displaying Notifications
- Creating an Accordion
- Developing a ToDoList
- And more...

Essentially, this project serves as a sandbox where I can experiment with different features. The goal is to gain practical experience and understanding of these functionalities, making it easier for me to integrate them into larger projects.

Now, let's embark on this journey of exploration and have some fun!
